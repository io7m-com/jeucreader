## jeucreader

The `jeucreader` package provides an interface for reading Unicode codepoints
one at a time.

## Features

* Unicode codepoint reader interface.
* High coverage test suite.
* Written in pure Java 17 with no dependencies.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.

## Motivation

For some reason, Java does not expose any interface to read individual Unicode
codepoints from any kind of I/O stream. It _does_ provide methods to, for
example, read text into a `String` and then iterate over the codepoints of
the `String`.

The `jeucreader` package attempts to provide this missing functionality.

## Usage

Given a `java.io.Reader r`, instantiate a `UnicodeCharacterReaderType` and
use it to read individual codepoints:

```
Reader r;

try (var u = UnicodeCharacterReader.newReader(r)) {
  int c0 = u.readCodePoint();
  int c1 = u.readCodePoint();
  int c2 = u.readCodePoint();
  ...
}
```

On consuming malformed text, the reader may raise subtypes of `IOException`
such as `InvalidSurrogatePair`, `MissingLowSurrogate`, `OrphanLowSurrogate`,
and etc.
